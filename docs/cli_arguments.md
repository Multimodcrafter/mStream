As of v4.7.0 there is only one cli parameter:

`--json` || `-j`

It accepts an argument of a json config file path
```
mstream -j /path/to/config.json
```

NOTE: v5 aims to simplify the setup process of mstream as much as possible. The `--wizard` argument was removed in favor of Admin UI. If you have any opinions, let me know in the discord channel or on github.
